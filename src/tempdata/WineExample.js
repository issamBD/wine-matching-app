    "pairingText": "Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Steak. After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Sterling Vineyards Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 29 dollars per bottle.",
